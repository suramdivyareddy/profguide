# ProfGuide - University Course and Professor Rating Portal

## Overview

**ProfGuide** is a university-specific course and professor rating portal designed to provide students with **reliable and detailed feedback** to help them make informed academic decisions. Unlike existing platforms like RateMyProfessors, ProfGuide ensures that only **verified students** who have completed a course can submit reviews. This approach aims to address the issues of biased and anonymous reviews, providing a more trustworthy resource for students. The platform also provides **valuable insights for professors** to enhance their teaching strategies.

## Problems Addressed

Existing platforms for course and professor evaluations, such as RateMyProfessors, have significant shortcomings:

*   **Lack of Course-Specific Feedback**: They primarily focus on general professor evaluations rather than specific feedback about the courses they teach.
*   **Biased and Anonymous Reviews:** Reviews are often anonymous, which raises concerns about their reliability and accuracy.
*  **Unreliable Information**: Reviews can be skewed by extreme opinions, making it difficult to trust the information.
*   **Limited Access to University Evaluations**: University-run course evaluations are often not made public, limiting their usefulness for students.

ProfGuide aims to solve these problems by providing a transparent, reliable, and detailed evaluation system.

## Target Users

*   **University Students**: From freshmen to seniors across all academic disciplines.
*   **Professors**: Seeking constructive feedback to improve their teaching methods.

## Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **Backend:** Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment.
    *   Express framework for building web applications and APIs.
    *   JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication.
*   **Database:** SQL database for storing user data, reviews, and course information.
*   **Cloud Hosting:** The database is hosted on a cloud platform like AWS (Amazon Web Services).

## Project Goals

The main goals of this project are to:

*   Create a **reliable evaluation system**.
*   Enhance **course-specific feedback**.
*   Foster **constructive feedback for professors**.
*   Encourage **student engagement**.
*   Ultimately contribute to enhancing the overall **educational experience** for all stakeholders involved.

## Research and User Interviews

The design of ProfGuide was heavily influenced by user research and interviews conducted with four students from diverse academic backgrounds. These interviews highlighted the need for verified reviews, course-specific details, and transparency in course information.

## Future Enhancements
The platform will also include mechanisms for ongoing feedback, enabling users to share their thoughts on the effectiveness of the platform itself.
